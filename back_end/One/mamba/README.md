#Mamba

I'm *still* working on this Pyramid application. Basically, it is meants to display user's boards, cards or lists using Trello API.
Given that I started learning how to use Pyramid less than a week ago, this pretty basic. For what I can tell, there is still room for improvment.


The docs are detailed here : 
* [Pyramid] (http://pyramid-cookbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
* [Trello] (https://developers.trello.com/apis)


## Setup

First
Create a virtual env
```sh
export VENV=~/env
```
Then install the app, *make sure you open the terminal at the root of mamba*
```sh
$VENV/bin/python setup.py develop
```

You're ready to try now after this last line 
```sh
$VENV/bin/pserve development.ini
```
